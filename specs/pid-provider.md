# PID provider - Wallet

## Workflow

### Wallet user requests a PID.
Wallets user selects a PID provider from which to obtain their PID.

### Wallet generates per-PID keys
The wallet generates:
- Per-PID Key Pair: A public/private key pair used for proof-of-possession.
- Retrieval Passkey: A  4096-character secret to make a secure, handshake to retreive the token

### Wallet redirects to PID provider
The wallet creates a URL to redirect the user to the PID provider with the public key, passkey and a redirect URI back to the wallet.

### PID provider authenticates the user
The user has to login to the PID provider to authenticate their identity and receive their PID.

### PID provider signs the PID
PID provider formats user's PID into a SD-JWT format, signs it with it's own private key and binds the PID with user's public key.

### PID provider stores signed PID
After signing the PID, PID provider stores it together with user's passkey and waits for the wallet to request the token with the passkey as a handshake.

### Wallet requests the PID
Wallet now makes a separate API call to the PID provider with the passkey as proof of identity.

### PID provider issues the PID
PID provider responds to the request with a signed PID in SD-JWT format.

### PID provider deletes the token
PID provider deletes issued token, or after a certain amount of time if the wallets faiils to ask for it in time.
